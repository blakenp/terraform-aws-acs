# Terraform-AWS-ACS #

This repository contains a foundation of code taken from the BYU OIT terraform module found [here](https://github.com/byu-oit/terraform-aws-acs-info). Much of the original code has been removed and simplified for the purpose of mainly using this custom terraform module for personal projects. The original code is under the Apache Version 2.0 License, hence this repo also includes this same license.

## Main Changes to Original Terraform Module ##

I changed the main.tf, output.tf, and variables.tf files and removed github acitons files among others. Again, the purpose of this edited custom terraform module is to allow for very bare-minimum github oidc.
